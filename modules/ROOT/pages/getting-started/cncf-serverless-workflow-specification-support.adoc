This document describes the information about Kogito implementation of the link:{spec_website_url}[Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Serverless Workflow] specification.

Kogito implements version link:{spec_doc_url}[{spec_version}] of the Serverless Workflow specification.

The following table shows the implementation status for each Serverless Workflow specification feature.

[NOTE]
====
Kogito does not support link:{spec_doc_url}#Retry-Definition[Retries], link:{spec_doc_url}#sleep-state[Sleep State], and link:{spec_doc_url}#workflow-timeouts[Timeouts] features of Serverless Workflow specification.

[[states]]
== States

The link:{spec_doc_url}#parallel-state[Parallel State] of the workflow states feature works in a single thread. This means that a Parallel State does not create one thread per branch, simulating an actual parallel behavior.

[NOTE]
====
Kogito does not support the link:{spec_doc_url}#sleep-state[Sleep State] feature. However, this feature will be supported in a future release.

The following table shows all the workflow states that Kogito supports in the Serverless Workflow specification {spec_version} version:

|===

For additional functions, the Serverless Workflow specification support the `custom` function type, such as `sysout` and `java`. For more information about these custom function types, see xref:core/custom-functions-support.adoc[Custom functions for your Serverless Workflow service].

[[events]]
== Events

Kogito supports events of the workflow model as defined in the link:{spec_doc_url}#Event-Definition[Serverless Workflow specification definition], except the following:

* `resultEventRef` property in link:{spec_doc_url}#eventref-definition[`EventRefDefinition`] is not implemented and, if specified, this property is ignored. Same functionality can be achieved by using xref:eventing/working-with-callbacks.adoc[Callback] state.
* link:{spec_doc_url}#correlation-definition[Correlation] has limited support. see xref:eventing/event-correlation-with-workflows.adoc[Event correlation with Serverless Workflows].

[[workflow_data]]
== Serverless Workflow data

Kogito supports the implementation of the data manipulation feature using `jq` (default) or `jsonpath` expressions.

`jsonpath` expressions can have limitations in specific scenarios of complex data manipulation. For more information, see link:{spec_doc_url}#workflow-data[Workflow Data] section in the Serverless Workflow specification documentation.

Kogito also supports data filtering. For more information about the data filtering, see link:{spec_doc_url}#state-data-filters[State data filters] section in the Serverless Workflow specification documentation.

[[expressions]]
== Expressions

Kogito supports `jq` or `jsonpath` to define the Serverless Workflow expressions. `jq` is the default expression language, however, if you want to use `jsonpath`, set the `expressionLang` attribute in the workflow definition as shown in the following example:

.Example of changing the default expression language
[source,json]
----
{
  "id": "myworkflow",
  "version": "1.0",
  "expressionLang": "jsonpath",
  "name": "Workflow example",
  "description": "An example of how to use jsonpath expressions"
}
----

[WARNING]
====
`jsonpath` expression is not recommended because of the limitations of the language for data manipulation. Instead, you can use `jq` in various use cases.
====


[[error_handling]]
== Error handling

Kogito supports the error handling feature as described in the link:{spec_doc_url}#workflow-error-handling[Serverless Workflow specification definition].

For more information about error handling, see xref:core/understanding-workflow-error-handling.adoc[Serverless Workflow Error Handling].

[[retries]]
== Retries

Kogito does not support Retries feature, however, it will be implemented in a future release.

Alternatively, you can use xref:core/understanding-workflow-error-handling.adoc[Serverless Workflow Error Handling].

[[timeouts]]
== Timeouts

Kogito does not support Timeouts feature, however, it will be implemented in a future release.

[[compensation]]
== Compensation

Kogito supports workflow compensation as described in the link:{spec_doc_url}#Workflow-Compensation[Serverless Workflow specification definition].

For more information about compensations, see xref:use-cases/orchestration-based-saga-pattern.adoc[Orchestration-based SAGA pattern].

[[constants]]
== Constants

Kogito supports workflow constants as described in the link:{spec_doc_url}#workflow-constants[Serverless Workflow specification definition].

[[secrets]]
== Secrets

Kogito supports workflow secrets as described in the link:{spec_doc_url}#workflow-secrets[Serverless Workflow specification definition].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Secrets are associated with the link:{quarkus_config_guide_url}[Quarkus Configuration] module. This means that any form of configuration that Quarkus supports is also supported in Kogito.
