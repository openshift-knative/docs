[[proc-create-sw-project-kn-cli]]
== Creating a workflow project using Knative CLI

After installing the {context} plug-in, you can use the `create` command with `kn workflow` to scaffold a new workflow project in your current directory.

The `create` command sets up Quarkus project containing minimal extensions to build a workflow project. Also, the generated workflow project contains a "hello world" `workflow.sw.json` file in your `./<project-name>/src/main/resources` directory.

.Prerequisites
* {context} plug-in for Knative CLI is installed.
+
For more information about installing the plug-in, see <<proc-install-sw-plugin-kn-cli, Installing the {context} plug-in for Knative CLI>>.
ifeval::["{kogito_version_redhat}" != ""]
* You followed the steps in xref:getting-started/create-your-first-workflow-service.adoc#proc-configuring-maven-rhbq[Configuring your Maven project to Red Hat build of Quarkus and OpenShift Serverless Logic]
endif::[]

.Procedure
. In Knative CLI, enter the following command to create a new project:
+
--
.Creates a project named `new-project`
[source,shell]
----
kn workflow create
----

By default, the generated project is named as `new-project`. You can overwrite the project name by using the `[-n|--name]` flag as follows:

.Create a project named `my-project`
[source,shell]
----
kn workflow create --name my-project
----
--

. Add more extensions to the Quarkus project during its creation by using the `[-e|--extension]` flag as follows:
+
--
.Create a project with `quarkus-jsonp` and `quarkus-smallrye-openapi` extensions
[source,shell]
----
kn workflow create --extension quarkus-jsonp,quarkus-smallrye-openapi
----

You can add multiple extensions using the comma-separated names of the extensions in the previous command.

[NOTE]
====
When you run the `create` command for the first time, it might take a while due to the necessity of downloading the required dependencies for the Quarkus project.

[[proc-build-sw-project-kn-cli]]
== Building a workflow project using Knative CLI

After creating your workflow project, you can use the `build` command with `kn workflow` to build your workflow project in your current directory and to generate a container image.

The process of building your workflow project produces a `knative.yml` file in the `./target/kubernetes` folder. If your workflow contains events, then the building process also generates a `kogito.yml` file.

.Prerequisites
* {context} plug-in for Knative CLI is installed.
+
For more information about installing the plug-in, see <<proc-install-sw-plugin-kn-cli, Installing the {context} plug-in for Knative CLI>>.

* A workflow project is created.
+
For more information about creating a workflow project, see <<proc-create-sw-project-kn-cli, Creating workflow project using Knative CLI>>.

.Procedure
. In Knative CLI, enter the following command to build your workflow project:
+
--
.Build the project and generate a local image named `dev.local/my-project`
[source,shell]
----
kn workflow build --image dev.local/my-project
----

[NOTE]
====
By using `dev.local` as repository, you can deploy your {context} project in a local environment without having to push the image to a container registry.
====

To use the `build` command, you need to provide either `--image` or `--image-name` flag. In the previous command, you can use the `[-i|--image]` in several ways, such as:

* --image=[name]
* --image=[name]:[tag]
* --image=[repository]/[name]
* --image=[repository]/[name]:[tag]
* --image=[registry]/[repository]/[name]
* --image=[registry]/[repository]/[name]:[tag]

[NOTE]
====
The default value for `registry` and `tag` is `quay.io` and `latest` respectively.
====

Also, you can use specific flags to compose the full name of the image as follows:

* `--image-registry`
* `--image-repository`
* `--image-name`
* `--image-tag`

In case the `--image` flag is composed with specific flags as shown in the following command, then the specific value overrides the `--image` flag:

.Build the project and generate a local image named `quay.io/other-user/my-project:1.0.1`
[source,shell]
----
kn workflow build --image my-user/my-project:1.0.0 --image-repository other-user --image-tag 1.0.1
----

[[con-build-strategy-kn-cli]]
=== Strategy for building a workflow project

You can use the following strategies to build a workflow project and to generate the container image:

Using Jib::
+
--
link:https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib[Jib] is an extension that builds a container image without the necessity of a container runtime. When using the Jib extension, the rebuilds are fast and the resultant container image is optimized.

You can use the following commands to build a workflow project and to generate a local image using Jib:

.Build a project and generate a local image using Jib
[source,shell]
----
kn workflow build --image dev.local/my-project --jib
----
The generated container image can be saved in the Docker runtime.

.Build a project and generate a local image using Jib
[source,shell]
----
kn workflow build --image dev.local/my-project --jib-podman
----
Using the previous command, the generated container image can be saved in the Podman runtime.

If you do not want to use any container runtime, then use `--push` to push the generated container image to the respective registry as shown in the following command:

.Build a project and push the image using Jib
[source,shell]
----
kn workflow build --image my-project --jib --push
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before using the `--push` option, ensure that you have access to your registry. You can get the access using Docker or Podman login.
====
--

Using Docker::
+
--
The process of building your workflow project using Docker is straightforward and also a default approach.

When using Docker, you can automatically push the container image to the respective registry by using the `--push` option as shown in the following command:

.Build a project and push the image using Docker
[source,shell]
----
kn workflow build --image my-project --push
----
--

[[proc-deploy-sw-project-kn-cli]]
== Deploying a workflow project using Knative CLI

You can use the `deploy` command combined with `kn workflow` to deploy your workflow project in your current directory. However, before deploying the project, you must build your workflow project as the build process produces deployment files, such as `knative.yml` and `kogito.yml` (In case of events) in the `./target/kubernetes` folder.

.Prerequisites
* {context} plug-in for Knative CLI is installed.
+
For more information about installing the plug-in, see <<proc-install-sw-plugin-kn-cli, Installing the {context} plug-in for Knative CLI>>.

* A workflow project is created.
+
For more information about created a workflow project, see <<proc-create-sw-project-kn-cli, Creating workflow project using Knative CLI>>.

* A workflow project is built.
+
For more information about building your workflow project, see <<proc-build-sw-project-kn-cli, Building workflow project using Knative CLI>>.

.Procedure
. In Knative CLI, enter the following command to deploy your workflow project:
+
--
.Deploy a workflow project
[source,shell]
----
kn workflow deploy
----

If the deployment files (`knative.yml` and `kogito.yml`) are saved in any other folder instead of `./target/kubernetes`, then you can override the path using the `--path` flag with deployment command as follows:

.Deploy a workflow project using `--path`
[source,shell]
----
kn workflow deploy --path other-path
----

Also, ensure that you have access to your cluster and your cluster can access the generated container image.

[NOTE]
====
You can use the `kubectl` command line if you want to use a complex deployment setup for your workflow project.

[[proc-build-sw-project-source]]
== Building a workflow project from source

As an alternative, you can build your workflow project from source.

.Prerequisites

+
--
.Clone `kie-tools` repository
[source,shell]
----
git clone git@github.com:kiegroup/kie-tools.git
----
--

. Navigate to the cloned `kie-tools` directory and enter the following command to access the {context} plug-in:
+
--
.Access {context} plug-in
[source,shell]
----
cd kie-tools
pnpm bootstrap
pnpm -F @kie-tools/kn-plugin-workflow... build:dev
----
--

. Go to the plug-in folder and enter the following command to build the workflow project:
+
--
.Build workflow project from source
[source,shell]
----
cd packages/kn-plugin-workflow
go mod tidy
----
--

You have successfully built your workflow project from source.
