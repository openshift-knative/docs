= Example of {product_name} application using callback state with Quarkus

To understand the Callback state, see the link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-callback-quarkus[`serverless-workflow-callback-quarkus`] example application in GitHub repository. 

The initial model of the `serverless-workflow-callback-quarkus` example application is empty. Once the workflow is started, it publishes a CloudEvent of the `resume` type and waits for a CloudEvent, which contains the type `wait`.

A listener consumes the CloudEvent with the `resume` type and simulates the behavior of an external service. Consequently, on the external service side, when the actions associated with the `resume` type CloudEvent are completed, the listener publishes a `wait` type CloudEvent. Once the `wait` type CloudEvent is received, the workflow moves to the next state and ends successfully.

To use the Callback state in a workflow, first CloudEvent types such as `resume` and `wait` are declared that the workflow uses. Following is an example of CloudEvents declaration in a workflow definition:

.Example of CloudEvents declaration in a workflow definition
[code,json]
----
"events": [
    {
      "name": "resumeEvent",
      "source": "",
      "type": "resume"
    },
    {
      "name": "waitEvent",
      "source": "",
      "type": "wait"
    }
  ]
----

After that, a Callback state is declared. The Callback state publishes a `resume` type CloudEvent and waits for a CloudEvent with `wait` type. The published CloudEvent contains a `move` data field, and the CloudEvent that is received is expected to contain a `result` data field. According to the link:{spec_doc_url}#event-data-filters[eventDataFilter], the `result` data field is added to the workflow model as a `move` field.

Following is an example of declaring a Callback state that handles the `wait` type CloudEvent:

.Example of a Callback State declaration handling the `wait` CloudEvent
[code,json]
----
{
      "name": "waitForEvent",
      "type": "callback",
      "action": {
        "name": "publishAction",
        "eventRef": {
          "triggerEventRef": "resumeEvent",
          "data": "{move: \"This is the initial data in the model\"}"
        }
      },
      "eventRef": "waitEvent",
      "eventDataFilter": {
        "data": ".result",
        "toStateData": ".move"
      },
      "transition": "finish"
    }
----

An link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-callback-quarkus/src/main/java/org/kie/kogito/examples/PrintService.java[event listener] consumes the `resume` type CloudEvent and publishes a new `wait` type CloudEvent. Following is an example of a Java method that publishes the `wait` type CloudEvent:

.Example of a Java method that publishes the `wait` CloudEvent
[code,java]
----

    private String generateCloudEvent(String id, String input) {
        Map<String, Object> eventBody = new HashMap<>();
        eventBody.put("result", input + " and has been modified by the event publisher");
        eventBody.put("dummyEventVariable", "This will be discarded by the process");
        try {
            return objectMapper.writeValueAsString(CloudEventBuilder.v1()
                    .withId(UUID.randomUUID().toString())
                    .withSource(URI.create(""))
                    .withType("wait")
                    .withTime(OffsetDateTime.now())
                    .withExtension(CloudEventExtensionConstants.PROCESS_REFERENCE_ID, id)
                    .withData(objectMapper.writeValueAsBytes(eventBody))
                    .build());
        } catch (JsonProcessingException e) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(e);
        }

    }
----

After that, the workflow application consumes the event published by the listener and sets the result field. The consumed CloudEvent contains an attribute named `kogitoprocrefid`, which holds the workflow instance ID of the workflow.

The `kogitoprocrefid` attribute is crucial because when the correlation is not used, then this attribute is the only way for the Callback state to identify that the related CloudEvent needs to be used to resume the workflow. For more information about correlation, see xref:eventing/event-correlation-with-workflows.adoc[Event correlation in {product_name}].

Note that each workflow is identified by a unique instance ID, which is automatically included in any published CloudEvent, as `kogitoprocinstanceid` CloudEvent extension.

The following example shows that the event listener takes the workflow instance ID of a workflow from a CloudEvent attribute named `kogitoprocinstanceid`, which is associated with the CloudEvent that is consumed. 

.Example of a Java method that consumes the `resume` CloudEvent 
[source,java]
----
    @Incoming("in-resume")
    @Outgoing("out-wait")
    @Acknowledgment(Strategy.POST_PROCESSING)
    public String onEvent(Message<String> message) {
        Optional<CloudEvent> ce = CloudEventUtils.decode(message.getPayload());
        JsonCloudEventData cloudEventData = (JsonCloudEventData) ce.get().getData();
        return generateCloudEvent(ce.get().getExtension(CloudEventExtensionConstants.PROCESS_INSTANCE_ID).toString(), cloudEventData.getNode().get("move").asText());
    }

Apache Kafka configuration in `serverless-workflow-callback-quarkus`::
+
--
The `serverless-workflow-callback-quarkus` example application requires an external broker to manage the associated CloudEvents. The default setup in the `serverless-workflow-callback-quarkus` example application uses link:{kafka_doc_url}[Apache Kafka]. However, you can also use xref:use-cases/advanced-developer-use-cases/event-orchestration/consume-produce-events-with-knative-eventing.adoc[Knative Eventing].

Apache Kafka uses topics to publish or consume messages. In the `serverless-workflow-callback-quarkus` example application, two topics are used, matching the name of the CloudEvent types that are defined in the workflow, such as `resume` and `wait`. The `resume` and `wait` CloudEvent types are configured in the link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-callback-quarkus/src/main/resources/application.properties[`application.properties`] file. 

For more information about using Apache Kafka with events, see link:xref:use-cases/advanced-developer-use-cases/event-orchestration/consume-producing-events-with-kafka.adoc[Consuming and producing events using Apache Kafka].
