This document describes how you can build dashboards to monitor your workflows data. 

To build the dashboards, you need data, which you can acquire from your workflows using one of the following methods:

* Enable metrics
* Integrate with Data Index to consume data using the REST API
* Use custom mechanisms, such as `ProcessInstanceListener`

The following sections describes the process of creating dashboards using metrics and Data Index GraphQL REST API.

== Dashboards for workflows

The dashboards for workflows are visualization of data that run on the client side. The dashboards are created using link:{dashbuilder_url}[Dashbuilder], which consumes data from any JSON source. You can define a dashboard in YAML format.

To use the Dashbuilder, download and uncompress the `dashbuilder-client` NPM package. Also, edit the `setup.js` file to link your YAML files. For more information about using Dashbuilder, see link:https://www.dashbuilder.org/docs/#_client_only[Dashbuilder documentation].

== Building dashboards using metrics

You can build dashboards to monitor the data of your workflows using metrics.

.Prerequisites
* A workflow application is created. 
+
For more information about creating a workflow, see xref:use-cases/advanced-developer-use-cases/getting-started/create-your-first-workflow-service.adoc[Creating your first workflow service].

.Procedure
. To enable metrics for your workflows application add `org.kie.kogito:kogito-addons-quarkus-monitoring-prometheus` dependency in `pom.xml` file of your application:
+
--
.Add metrics dependency to `pom.xml` file
[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
      <artifactId>kogito-addons-quarkus-monitoring-prometheus</artifactId>
    </dependency>
----

You can find the metrics in `/q/metrics` path.

The dashbuilder can consume the data of your workflow directly from the metrics endpoints. Therefore, you can use a link:{jsonata_url}[JSONAta expression] to format the metrics and display the metrics in a table using the following example of YAML code:

.Example YAML to show metrics in a table
[source,yaml]
----
datasets:
  - uuid: swf_metrics
    url: http://localhost:8080/q/metrics
    expression: >-
        $map($, function($l) { 
                [
                    $l[0], 
                    $contains($l[1], "process_id") ? 
                                            $replace($match($l[1], /process_id=".*?"/).match, 
                                            "process_id", 
                                            "workflow") : 
                                            $l[1], 
                    $l[2] = "NaN" ? -1 : $l[2]
                ]
            }
        )

               uuid: swf_metrics

.Example metrics in a table
image::integrations/dashbuilder-metrics-table.png[]
--

. To extract a specific information from your workflow, use specific metrics. Metrics related to workflows include:
+
--
* `kogito_process_instance_completed_total`: Completed workflows
* `kogito_process_instance_started_total`: Started workflows
* `kogito_process_instance_running_total`: Running workflows
* `kogito_process_instance_duration_seconds_sum`: Workflows total duration

When you display the metrics, you can filter the data to include the specific metrics. You can use the *metrics* and *bar chart* components in dashbuilder to display the specific metrics and after filtering the metrics, you can put the information in bar charts as shown in the following example YAML code:

If you are using Prometheus, you can use PROMQL with Prometheus REST API and transform the result to JSON format that is supported by dashbuilder to build the dashoards.

For more information about dashbuilder and Prometheus, see link:https://blog.kie.org/2022/07/creating-prometheus-dashboards-using-dashbuilder.html[Creating Prometheus Dashboards using Dashbuilder].

[[proc-sw-dashboard-data-index]]
== Building dashboards using Data Index

Data Index is a service that contains all the data related to the execution of your workflow. The Data Index service is available during the development mode. By default, you can access the Data Index at `http://localhost:8180`. 

The Data Index service uses GraphQL, so that dashbuilder can connect with the service using its REST API and transform the result to the supported format.

.Prerequisites
* A workflow application is created. 
+
For more information about creating a workflow, see xref:use-cases/advanced-developer-use-cases/getting-started/create-your-first-workflow-service.adoc[Creating your first workflow service].

.Procedure
. Go to the Data Index GraphQL interface (default to `http://localhost:8180/graphiql`) and test your query.
+
--
The following is an example of GraphQL query that lists all the workflows:

.Example GraphQL query to retrieve all workflows
[source,json]
----
{
  ProcessInstances {
    processId
    processName
    state
    start
    end
    businessKey
    error {message}
  }
}
----
--

. Run the GraphQL query. 
+
When you run the query, note that the URL is modified to includes the query.

. Copy the URL and modify `graphiql` to `graphql`.
+
--
When you access the URL with `graphql`, it returns the result in a JSON format as shown in the following example:

.GraphQL JSON result when using the query
[source,json]
----
{
  "data": {
    "ProcessInstances": [
      {
        "processId": "yamlgreet",
        "processName": "Greeting workflow",
        "state": "COMPLETED",
        "start": "2022-07-01T16:08:12.038Z",
        "end": "2022-07-01T16:08:12.061Z",
        "businessKey": null,
        "error": null
      },
    ]
  }
}
----

[NOTE]
====
Internally, workflows are referenced as processes, therefore the `processId` is the workflow ID and `processName` is the workflow name.
====
--

. Transform the response to the transform expression.
+
--
When you transform the response, note that the response includes the columns metdata for the data set.

.Example transform expression to retrieve fields from JSON response
[source,json]

{
    "columns" :[
        {"id": "Workflow Id", "type": "label"},

        {"id": "State", "type": "label"},
        {"id": "Start", "type": "label"},
        {"id": "End", "type": "label"},
        {"id": "Business Key", "type": "label"},

    ],    
    "values" : $.data.ProcessInstances.[ processId, processName, state, start, end, businessKey ? businessKey : "", error ? error.message : ""]
}
----
--

. Create your dashboard using the transform expression and the URL mentioned in the previous step.

The previous example of dashboard contains bar chart that counts the workflow instances by `State` and lists all the dashboards in a table.
