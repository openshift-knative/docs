:description: Defining input schema for Serverless Workflow
:keywords: kogito, workflow, serverless, dataInputSchema

The `dataInputSchema` in the link:{spec_doc_url}#workflow-definition-structure[Serverless Workflow specification] is a parameter used in the workflow definition. The `dataInputSchema` parameter validates the workflow data input against a defined JSON Schema. It is important to provide `dataInputSchema`, as it is used to verify if the provided workflow data input is correct before any workflow states are executed.

You can define a `dataInputSchema` as follows:

.`dataInputSchema` definition
[source,json]
----
"dataInputSchema": {
   "schema": "URL_to_json_schema",
   "failOnValidationErrors": false
}
----

In the previous definition, the `schema` property is a URI, which holds the path to the JSON schema used to validate the workflow data input. The URI can be a classpath URI, a file, or an HTTP URL. If a classpath URI is specified, then the JSON schema file must be placed in the resources section of the project.

You can see the link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus[`serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus`] example application of a workflow definition with `dataInputSchema`. See the link:{kogito_sw_examples_url}/serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus/src/main/resources/expression.sw.json[Serverless Workflow JSON file] for more details.

When a workflow definition contains a `dataInputSchema` attribute, the workflow application generates an OpenAPI file, such as `http://localhost/q/openapi`. The generated OpenAPI file references the schema file, which helps in defining the input data for the workflows. For more information about the OpenAPI file, see link:{open_api_spec_url}[OpenAPI specification].

If you want to generate an OpenAPI file for a workflow, then you must add the link:{quarkus_swagger_url}#expose-openapi-specifications[Quarkus dependency] in the project.
