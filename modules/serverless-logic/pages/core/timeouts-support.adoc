Serverless Workflow specification defines a wide amount of possible link:{spec_doc_url}#workflow-timeout-definition[timeout configurations].
Among them, {product_name} currently supports workflow and event timeouts.

Regardless of its application scope (workflow or state), you can not define the timeouts as a specific point in time, but they should be an amount of time, a duration, which is considered to start when the referred scope becomes active. Timeouts use the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[`ISO 8601` data and time standard] to specify a duration of time.
It follows the format `PnDTnHnMn.nS` with days considered to be exactly 24 hours.
For instance, `PT15M` configures 15 minutes, and `P2DT3H4M` defines 2 days, 3 hours and 4 minutes.

== Workflow timeout

You can set up the maximum amount of time a workflow might be running before being canceled. This is configured in the header section of the flow, by using the link:{spec_doc_url}#workflowexectimeout-definition[WorkflowExecTimeout definition]. Only the `duration` property is currently implemented.
Once canceled, the workflow is considered to be finished and will not be accessible through a GET request anymore. So it behaves as if the interrupt was `true` by default.

For example, in order to cancel the workflow after an hour of execution, you might add the following snippet.

.Example of workflow timeout
[source,json]
[source,json]
----
"timeouts": {
    "workflowExecTimeout": "PT1H"
}
----

== Event timeout

When you define a state in a serverless workflow, you can use the `timeouts` property to configure the maximum time to complete this state.
When that time is overdue, the state is considered timed-out, and the engine continues the execution from this state. The execution flow depends on the state type, for instance,
a transition to a next state.
All the properties you can use to configure state timeouts are described in the link:{spec_doc_url}#event-timeout-definition[Serverless Workflow specification].

Event-based states can use the sub-property `eventTimeout` to configure the maximum time to wait for an event to arrive.


=== Callback state timeout
Callback state can be used when you need to execute an action, in general to call an external service, and wait for an asynchronous response in form of an event, the callback.

Once the response event is consumed, the workflow continues the execution, in general moving to the next state defined in the `transition` property. See more on xref:eventing/working-with-callbacks.adoc[Callback state in {product_name}].

Since the callback state halts the execution util the event is consumed, you can define an `eventTimeout` for it, and in case the event does not arrive in the defined duration time, the workflow continues the execution moving to the next state defined in the transition, see the <<callback-state, example>>.

     "transition": "FinalizeWithError"
   }
 ],
 "timeouts": {

 }
}

=== Switch state timeout


The switch state can be used when you need to take an action based on conditions, defined with the link:{spec_doc_url}#switch-state-event-conditions[eventConditions] property, where the workflow execution waits to make a decision depending on the events to be consumed and matched, defined through link:{spec_doc_url}#event-definition[event definition].

In this situation, you can define an event timeout, that controls the maximum time to wait for an event to match the conditions, if this time is expired, the workflow moves to the state defined in the `defaultCondition` property of the switch state, as you can see in the <<switch-state, example>>.

See more details about this state on the link:{spec_doc_url}#switch-date[Serverless Workflow specification].

        "transition": "DeniedVisa"
    }
    ],

        "transition": "HandleNoVisaDecision"
    },
        "timeouts": {
        "eventTimeout": "PT5S"
    }
}
----

=== Event state timeout

The `event` state is used to wait for one or more events to be received by the workflow and then continue the execution.
If the event state is a starting state, a new workflow instance is created.

[NOTE]
====
The event state is not supported as a starting state if the `exclusive` flag is set to `false`, therefore timeout is not supported in this case.
====

The `timeouts` property is used for this state to configure the maximum time the workflow should wait for the defined events to arrive.

If this time is exceeded and the events are not received, the workflow moves to the state defined in the `transition` property or ends the workflow instance without performing any actions in case of an end state.

You can see this in the <<event-state, example>>.

For more information about event state timeout, see link:{spec_doc_url}#event-timeout-definition[Serverless Workflow specification].

=== Deploying a timed-based workflow

In order to deploy a workflow that contains timeouts or any other timer-based action, it is necessary to have Job Service running in your environment, which is an external service responsible to control the workflows timers, see the <<job-service, section>> for more information.
In the <<timeout-example, timeout example>> you can see the details of how set up a Knative infrastructure with the workflow and job service running.

[#job-service]
=== Job Service configuration

All timer-related actions that might be declared in a workflow, are handled by a supporting service, called Job Service, which is responsible for managing, scheduling, and firing all actions (jobs) to be executed in the workflows.

Suppose the workflow service is not configured to use job service or there is no such service running. In that case, all timer-related actions use an embedded in-memory implementation of job service, which should not be used in production, since when the application shutdown, all timers are lost, which in a serverless architecture is a very common behavior with the scale to zero approach. That said, the no job service configuration can only be used for testing or development, but not for production.

The main goal of the Job Service is to work with only active jobs. The Job Service tracks only the jobs that are scheduled and that need to be executed. When a job reaches a final state, the job is removed from the Job Service.

When configured in your environment, all the jobs information and status changes are sent to the {product_name} `Data
Index Service`, where they can be indexed and made available by GraphQL queries.

[NOTE]
====
Data index service and the support for jobs information will be available in future releases.
====

==== Job Service persistence

An important configuration aspect of job service is the persistence mechanism, where all job information is stored in a database that makes this information durable upon service restarts and guarantees no information is lost.

[#job-service-postgresql]
==== PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is the recommended database to use with job service.
Additionally, it provides an initialization procedure that integrates link:https://flywaydb.org[Flyway] for the database initialization. It automatically controls the database schema, in this way all tables are created by the service.

In case you need to externally control the database schema, you can check the Flyway SQL scripts in link:{kogito_apps_url}/jobs-service/jobs-service-postgresql/src/main/resources/db/migration[migration] and apply them.

You need to set the proper configuration parameters when starting job service.
The example shows how to run PostgreSQL as a Kubernetes deployment, but you can run it the way it fits in your environment, the important part is to set all the configuration parameters points to your running instance of PostgreSQL.

==== Ephemeral
Alternatively, there is an in-memory database support that does not require any external database configuration, it can be used for testing and development purposes, but it is not recommended for production, since all jobs are lost upon a service restart or failure.

[NOTE]
====
The job service link:{jobs_service_image_url}[image] is equipped with the PostgreSQL and Ephemeral (InMemory) options that can be switched using the `JOBS_SERVICE_PERSISTENCE`. If not set, it defaults to the `ephemeral` option. For more information about the job service, the container image can be found link:{jobs_service_image_usage_url}[here].
====

=== Job service leader election

Currently, job service works in a single instance manner where there should be just one active instance of the service.

To avoid issues when deploying the service in the cloud, where it is common to eventually have more than one instance deployed, the job service supports a leader instance election process. Only the instance that become the leader activates the external communication to receive and schedule jobs.

All instances who are not leaders, stay inactive in a kind of wait state and try to become the leader continuously.

When a new instance of the service is started it is not set as a leader at startup time but instead, it starts the process to become one.

When an instance that is the leader for any issue stays irresponsive or it is shut down, one of the other running instances becomes the leader.

.Job Service leader election
image::core/job-service-leader.png[]

[NOTE]
====
This leader election mechanism uses the underlying persistence backend, which currently is only supported in the PostgreSQL implementation.
====

There is no need for any configuration to support this feature, the only requirement is to have the supported database with the data schema up-to-date as described in <<job-service-postgresql>>.

In case the underlying persistence does not support this feature, you should guarantee
that just one single instance of job service is running at the same time.

=== Job Service communication

[NOTE]
====
The Job Service does not execute a job but triggers a callback that might be an HTTP request or a Cloud Event that is
managed by the configured <<job-addon-configuration, jobs addon>> in the workflow application.
====

==== Knative Eventing

To configure the communication between the Job Service and the workflow runtime through the Knative eventing system, you must provide a set of configurations.

The Job Service configuration is done through the deployment descriptor shown in the <<job-service-deploy, example>>.

[[job-addon-configuration]]
==== Addon configuration in the workflow runtime

The communication from the workflow application with Job Service is done through an addon, which is responsible for publishing and consuming events related to timers.
When you run the workflow as a Knative service, you must add the `kogito-addons-quarkus-jobs-knative-eventing` to your project and provide the proper configuration.
