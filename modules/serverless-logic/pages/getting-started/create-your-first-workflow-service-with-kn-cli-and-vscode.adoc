= Creating and running workflow projects using KN CLI and Visual Studio Code

This guide showcases using the Knative Workflow CLI plugin and Visual Studio code to create & run {product_name} projects.

.Prerequisites
* xref:testing-and-troubleshooting/kn-plugin-workflow-overview.adoc[Knative Workflow CLI] {kn_cli_version} is installed.
* Visual Studio Code with https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-extension-serverless-workflow-editor[Red Hat Serverless Workflow Editor] is installed to edit your workflows.

.Preparing your environment 
* Install https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Docker] or https://podman.io/docs/installation[Podman].
* Install https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/[minikube].
* Install https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/[kubectl].
* Start minikube. Depending on your environment, set `--driver` flag to `podman` or `docker`
[source,bash]
----
minikube start --cpus 4 --memory 8096 --addons registry --addons metrics-server --insecure-registry "10.0.0.0/24" --insecure-registry "localhost:5000"  --driver=docker
----
* (optional) Install https://k9scli.io/[k9scli.io] 
* xref:cloud/operator/install-serverless-operator.adoc[]
* Install https://github.com/kiegroup/kie-tools/releases/tag/0.30.3[KN Workflow CLI] by downloading the correct distribution for your development environment and adding it to the PATH.

== Creating a workflow project with Visual Studio Code and KN CLI

Use the `create` command with kn workflow to scaffold a new SonataFlow project.

* Navigate to you development directory and create your project.
[source,bash]
----
kn workflow create -n my-sonataflow-project
----
* This will create a folder with name `my-sonataflow-project` and a sample workflow `workflow.sw.json`
[source,bash]
----
cd ./my-sonataflow-project
----
* Open the folder in Visual Studo Code and examine the created `workflow.sw.json` using our extension.

Now you can run the project and execute the workflow.

[[proc-running-app-with-kn-cli]]
== Running a Workflow project with Visual Studio Code and KN CLI

Use the `run` command with kn workflow to build and run the {product_name} project in local development mode.

* Run the project.  
[source,bash]
----
kn workflow run
----
* The Development UI wil be accesible at `localhost:8080/q/dev`
* You can now work on your project. Any changes will be picked up by the hot reload feature.
* See xref:testing-and-troubleshooting/quarkus-dev-ui-extension/quarkus-dev-ui-workflow-instances-page.adoc[Workflow instances] guide on how to run workflows via Development UI.
* Once you are done developing your project navigate to the terminal that is running the `kn workflow run` command and hit `Ctlr+C` to stop the development environment.

To deploy the finished project to a local cluster, proceed to the next section.

[[proc-deploying-app-with-kn-cli]]
== Deploying a workflow project with Visual Studio Code and KN CLI

Use the `deploy` command with kn workflow to deploy the {product_name} project into your local cluster.

* Deploy to minikube
[source,bash]
----
kn workflow deploy
----
* (Optional) Using k9scli you can examine your deployment.
* In a different bash instance, create a port mapping:
[source,bash]
----
minikube service hello --namespace default --url
----
* Use this URL to access your workflow instances using the Developer UI
** <RETURNED_URL>/q/dev/org.kie.kogito.kogito-quarkus-serverless-workflow-devui/workflowInstances
* To update the image run the `deploy` again, note that this may take some time.

* To stop the deployment, use the `undeploy` command:
[source,bash]
----
kn worklow undeploy
----
* You can validate your pod is terminating using k9s cli.

[[proc-testing-application]]
== Testing your workflow application

To test your workflow application you can use any capable REST client out there. All that is needeed is the URL of your deployed worklow project.

.Prerequisites
* You have your workflow project deployed using <<proc-deploying-app-with-kn-cli>> and you have the URL where it is deployed handy.

.Testing your workflow application
* To test your workflow project, access the Swagger UI on `<URL>/q/swagger-ui` to examine available endpoints.
* In order to execute the workflow once, run: 
[source,bash]
----
curl -X 'POST' \
  '<URL>/hello' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "workflowdata": {}
}'
----
* To examine executed instance you can use the GraphQL UI by navigating to
`<URL>/q/graphl-ui`.
