== Enabling VS Code extension to load OpenAPI files from remote service registries

The VS Code extension for Serverless Workflow editor can use link:{open_api_spec_url}[OpenAPI specification] files that are stored locally in the `specs` folder. Also, the OpenAPI specification files can be stored in remote service registries, providing auto-complete feature for function definitions. 

For more information about OpenAPI specification files path, see <<ref-sw-editor-settings, Serverless Workflow editor settings>>.

The VS Code extension configures a list of service registries, which enables the Serverless Workflow editor to load OpenAPI specification files that are stored in the external registries.

.Prerequisites
* VS Code extension for the Serverless Workflow editor is installed.
+
For more information about installing the VS Code extension, see <<proc-install-vscode-extension-sw-editor, Installing the VS Code Extension for Serverless Workflow editor>>.

.Procedure
. Open your workflow file in VS Code IDE and select the *Setup Service Registries* option.
. Navigate to the `settings.json` file.
. Add the list of service registries in the `settings.json` file using the `kogito.swf.serviceRegistries` key, which matches the following JSON schema:
+
--
.Service Registry Schema
[source,json]
----
 {
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "registries": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "name": { "type": "string" }, <1>
          "url": { <2>
            "type": "string",
            "format": "uri",
            "pattern": "^https?://?[-A-Za-z0-9+&@#/%?=_!:.]+[-A-Za-z0-9+&@#/%=~_|]"
          },
          "authProvider": { <3>
            "type": "string",
            "enum": ["none", "red-hat-account"],
            "default": "none"
          }
        },
        "required": ["name", "url", "authProvider"]
      }
    }
  }
}
----

In the registries array, each item must contain the following properties:

<1> *name*: Identifier provided for a registry.
<2> *url*: URL for the REST API of the remotes service registry, such as Apicurio registry.
<3> *authProvider*: Type of authentication for the remote service registry. This property contains values as *none* (no authentication) and *red-hat-account* (log in with your Red Hat account).

Following is an example of a service registry configuration:

    "kogito.swf.serviceRegistries": {
        "registries": [
            {

                "url": "https://{url-to-openshift-registry}/apis/registry/v2",
                "authProvider": "red-hat-account"
            },
            {
                "name": "local",
                "url": "https://{url-to-local-registry}/apis/registry/v2",
                "authProvider": "none"
            },
        ]
    }
}

=== Using service registries for auto-completion

You can use the service registries for auto-completion feature in the Serverless Workflow VS Code extension. 

.Prerequisites
The following prerequisites are for the service registries that require Red Hat authentication:

* You have a link:{red_hat_sso_login_url}[Red Hat account] with access to link:{red_hat_hybrid_cloud_console_url}[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console].
* link:{red_hat_auth_vscode_marketplace_url}[Red Hat authentication] extension is installed.

.Procedure
. In a workflow file, click the *Setup Service Registries* options and navigate to the `settings.json` file to configure the service registries.

Once you configure the service registry settings, the function definition section in the workflow file displays a *Log in Service Registries* button. 

[NOTE]
====
The *Log in Service Registries* button appears when the function definition is configured to a remote service registry, such as Apicurio registry.
====
--

. Click on the *Log in Service Registries* option.
+
You are redirected to the Red Hat login (SSO) page.

. Log in with your Red Hat credentials to connect to the remote service registry.
+
--
[NOTE] 
====
You are redirected to the Red Hat login (SSO) page only if the *authProvider* property contains the value of `red-hat-account` in the service registry settings.
====

[NOTE]
====
After selecting an option in the auto-complete dialog box, the OpenAPI specification file is downloaded into the `specs` folder. The downloaded OpenAPI specification file follows the _REGISTRY-NAME_OPERATION-NAME_VERSION_ format.
====

--

[NOTE]
====
The Serverless Workflow editor performs validation using JSON schema for the workflow file structure but not for the values, and auto-completion works with JSON but not with YAML.
====

To view the validation warnings and errors, go to *View* → *Problems* or press *Ctrl+Shift+M* to open the *Problems* tab.
