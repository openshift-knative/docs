In Kogito Serverless Workflow Tools, the Workflow Instances page is used to monitor and manage the available instances. The Workflow Instances page displays a list of available instances and add filters to the list.

To create a workflow instance, you can use the Workflow Definitions page. For more information, see xref:serverless-logic:tooling/quarkus-dev-ui-extension/quarkus-dev-ui-workflow-definition-page.adoc[Workflow Definitions in Kogito Serverless Workflow Tools extension].

When you create a workflow instance, the instance appears in the workflow instances table on the page, containing the following details:

* *Id*: Displays the name and business key of an instance. Also, when you hover on the name of the workflow instance, a unique ID is displayed for the instance. You can click on the ID to navigate to the *Workflow Details* page.
* *Status*: Displays the current state of the instance. This column can contain *Active*, *Completed*, *Aborted*, *Error*, and *Suspended* as values.
* *Created*: Displays the time reference indicating when the instance is created.
* *Last Update*: Displays the time reference indicating when the instance is last updated.

You can also sort the columns of the workflow instances table.

On the Workflow Instances page, you can filter the list of workflow instances based on the states and business keys. By default, *Active*, *Completed*, *Aborted*, *Error*, and *Suspended* are applied on the list. You can use the *Status* drop-down to see the available states. To filter the workflow instances based on the states, select or unselect the states in the *Status* drop-down and click *Apply filter* button.

To filter the workflow instances based on business keys, enter a business key in the *Filter by business key* field and click *Apply filter* button.

To fetch the newly added workflow instances, click on the refresh icon next to the *Apply Filter* button. Also, to clear the applied filters and reset to the default state, click *Reset to default* button.

In the workflow instances table, the *Id* column contains a clickable link, which enables you to navigate to the *Workflow Details* page. The *Workflow Details* page contains various panels, providing detailed information about a workflow instance.

The Workflow Details page consists of the following panels:

* Serverless Workflow Diagram panel
* Timeline panel
* Details panel
* Variables panel

Serverless Workflow Diagram panel::
+
--
The Serverless Workflow Diagram panel enables you to explore the workflow diagram and execution path of the workflow instance. The workflow diagram and execution path are displayed by consuming the source which is exposed through the `kogito-addons-quarkus-source-files`.

To add the source files add-on configuration, add the following dependency to `pom.xml` file of your project:

.source-files add-on dependency in `pom.xml` file
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
  <artifactId>kogito-addons-quarkus-source-files</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

There are two ways to display the diagram.

1. Stunner Diagram
2. Mermaid Diagram

By default, the Stunner diagram is displayed. To toggle between the two diagrams you can use the `kogito.swf.stunner.enabled`(defaulted to true) environment variable in your application properties.

[NOTE]
====
For yaml-based workflow files, the mermaid diagram is displayed instead of the stunner diagram.
====

There is a slider available in the diagram panel, which when dragged to the right displays the source code in read-only mode.
