{context} projects can be deployed to an OpenShift instance via the OpenShift integration, allowing authors to test their implementations in a live environment. Note that these deployments are not meant for production, only development purposes.

== Deploying your first simple serverless project

Deploy your first {context} project to an OpenShift instance and see it running live.

.Prerequisites
* OpenShift integration has to be correctly configured (see how to xref:serverless-logic:tooling/serverless-logic-web-tools/serverless-logic-web-tools-openshift-integration.adoc[here]).

.Procedure
. Start by creating a project from one of the samples. For this tutorial, the **Greetings** sample is recommended, as it has no external dependencies and is easy to test and comprehend. Here's a brief explanation of what it does:
+
____
This example shows a single Operation State with one action that calls the "greeting" function. The workflow data input is assumed to be the name of the person to greet. The result of the action is assumed to be the greeting for the provided person's name, which is added to the state's data and becomes the workflow data output.
____
. On the editor page, click on the **Try on OpenShift** button, then, on the context menu, click on **Deploy "greetings" ({context})**;
. A modal should appear, showing deployment options:
  * **Deploy as a project**: This will be available if your current workspace has a full project structure (with a single `pom.xml` file);
    ** If the option is **disabled**: A pre-built image container that contains a Quarkus project will be used and all serverless workflow files will be placed inside `src/main/resources` folder of the project. In this case, it is important to make sure the serverless workflow files do not have any other dependencies because they are not included in the deployment.
    ** If the option is **enabled**: All files in the workspace will be deployed as-is, meaning no project template will be used. So it is up to you to make sure the project is _deployable_.
  * **Advanced options**:
    ** **Upload OpenAPI spec to Service Registry**: After a {context} is deployed, an OpenAPI spec is available in the deployed service. Checking this option will make the {serverless_logic_web_tools_name} poll for this spec and upload it to your configured Service Registry (_To use this option, you need to configure your Service Account and Service Registry on the Settings page. You can check how to configure it xref:serverless-logic:tooling/serverless-logic-web-tools/serverless-logic-web-tools-redhat-application-services-integration.adoc[here]_);
    ** **Attach KafkaSource to the deployment**: If your {context} has an Apache Kafka event dependency then this option should be checked (_To use this option, you need to configure your Service Account and Streams for Apache Kafka on the Settings page. You can check how to configure it xref:serverless-logic:tooling/serverless-logic-web-tools/serverless-logic-web-tools-redhat-application-services-integration.adoc[here]_).
. Leave everything unchecked and click on **Confirm**.
. A toast should show the following message: **Your deployment has been successfully started and will be available shortly. Please do not close this browser tab until the operation is completed.** and clicking on the **OpenShift deployments** icon should show your deployment status. The process should take a few minutes since a build needs to be completed before the services are up.

== Checking your deployment status

After deployment is successful you can check out multiple information about your service.

.Prerequisites
* OpenShift integration has to be correctly configured (see how to xref:serverless-logic:tooling/serverless-logic-web-tools/serverless-logic-web-tools-openshift-integration.adoc[here]);
* Have a successfully deployed project.
* The deployed project must have been deployed with the *Deploy as a project* option *unchecked*, as the Serverless deployment page is only available via the pre-built image container. If the option was checked the tool will open whatever `index.html` file your project provided.

.Procedure
. Click on the **OpenShift deployments** icon to show a list of deployments;
. If your deployment is successful (listed with a emoji:white_check_mark[1x]) you can click on it to access the **Serverless Deployment** page and check on the **Swagger UI** interface, **Open API** specification and **Metrics** page via DashBuilder.
