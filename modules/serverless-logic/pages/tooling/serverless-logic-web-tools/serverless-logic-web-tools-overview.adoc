== What's inside?

The {serverless_logic_web_tools_name} provides 3 different editors for your projects:

* {context} editor, for `.sw.json` or `.sw.yaml|yml` files;
* Serverless Decision editor, for `.yard.json` or `.yard.yaml|yml` files;
* Dashbuilder editor, for `dash.yaml|yml` files.

*Feature Preview*: For an improved experience when previewing your {context}, check out xref:serverless-logic:tooling/serverless-logic-web-tools/serverless-logic-web-tools-enable-kogito-swf-visualization.adoc[how to enable the new Kogito Serverless Workflow Visualization diagram].

== Getting started

Not much needs to be done to start creating your projects in the web tool. You can start by creating a new model from scratch or using one of the samples provided.

On the home page, choose the type of model you want to create, then click the button corresponding to the file type you wish (JSON or YAML).

.Create

A new workspace will be created, containing a single file of the chosen type. The file is created with the name "Untitled", but clicking its name allows you to rename it to your liking.

Editing workflow files will update the preview on the right-hand side of the editor and all files are saved automatically on every change.

The files are persisted in the browser, but syncing can be done with the xref:serverless-logic:tooling/serverless-logic-web-tools/serverless-logic-web-tools-github-integration.adoc[Github integration].
