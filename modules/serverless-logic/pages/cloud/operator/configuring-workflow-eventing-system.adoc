:keywords: kogito, sonataflow, workflow, serverless, operator, kubernetes, knative, knative-eventing, events

This document describes how to configure the eventing system for a {product_name} workflow.

In general, the following events are produced in a {product_name} installation:

* Workflow outgoing and incoming business events.

* SonataFlow system events sent from the workflow to the Data Index and Job Service respectively.

* SonataFlow system events sent from the Jobs Service to the Data Index Service.

The {operator_name} is designed to use the link:{knative_eventing_url}[Knative Eventing] system to resolve all the event communication between these services.

[NOTE]
====
In a regular SonataFlow installation, the preferred method is to use the <<platform-scoped-eventing-system-configuration>>, while the <<workflow-scoped-eventing-system-configuration>> is reserved only for advanced use cases.

[#platform-scoped-eventing-system-configuration]
== Platform-scoped Eventing system configuration

To configure a platform-scoped eventing system, you must use the field `spec.eventing.broker.ref` in the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR to refer to a Knative Eventing broker.

This information signals the {operator_name} to automatically link every workflow deployed in that namespace, with the `preview` or `gitops` profile, to `produce` and `consume` the events by using that Broker.

Additionally, the supporting services deployed in that namespace, that do not provide a custom eventing system configuration, will be linked to that broker.
For more information about configuring the supporting services eventing system, xref:cloud/operator/supporting-services.adoc#configuring-supporting-services-eventing-system[see].

The following `SonataFlowPlatform` CR fragment shows an example of such configuration:

include::../common/platform-scoped-eventing-system-configuration-example.adoc[]

[#workflow-scoped-eventing-system-configuration]
== Workflow-scoped Eventing system configuration

A workflow-scoped eventing system configuration provides the ability to do a fine-grained configuration of the eventing system for the events `produced` and `consumed` by a workflow.

To configure a workflow-scoped eventing system you must use the fields `spec.sink.ref` and `spec.sources[]` in the `SonataFlow` CR.

[#outgoing-eventing-system-configuration]
=== Outgoing Eventing system configuration

To configure a workflow-scoped eventing system for the workflow outgoing events, you must use the field `spec.sink.ref` in the `SonataFlow` CR.

This information signals the {operator_name} to automatically link the current workflow, to produce the events by using that Broker.
That includes, the {product_name} system events, and the workflow business events.

The following `SonataFlow` CR fragment shows an example of such configuration:

[#incoming-eventing-system-configuration]
=== Incoming Eventing system configuration

To configure a workflow-scoped eventing system for the workflow incoming events, you must use the field `spec.sources[]` in the `SonataFlow` CR.
And, you must add an entry in the array, for every event type that requires an individual configuration.

This information signals the SonataFlow Operator to automatically link the current workflow, to potentially `consume` the events from different Brokers, depending on the event type.

Incoming event types not configured with a particular Broker, are consumed by applying <<eventing-system-configuration-precedence-rules>>.

The following `SonataFlow` CR fragment shows an example of such configuration:

[#cluster-scoped-eventing-system-configuration]
== Cluster-scoped Eventing system configuration

When you use a SonataFlowClusterPlatform, the workflows are automatically linked to the `Broker` configured in the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR referred to by the given `SonataFlowClusterPlatform` CR, according to the <<eventing-system-configuration-precedence-rules>>.

[#eventing-system-configuration-precedence-rules]
== Eventing system configuration precedence rules

To configure the eventing system for a workflow, the {operator_name} use the following precedence rules:

. If the workflow has a configured eventing system, by using any of the <<outgoing-eventing-system-configuration, workflow-scoped outgoing eventing system>> or <<#incoming-eventing-system-configuration, workflow-scoped incoming eventing system>> configurations, that configuration applies.

. If the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR enclosing the workflow, is configured with a <<platform-scoped-eventing-system-configuration, platform-scoped eventing system>>, that configuration applies.

. If the current cluster, is configured with a <<cluster-scoped-eventing-system-configuration, cluster-scoped eventing system>>, that configuration apply.

. If none of the previous configurations exists, the workflow is configured to:
** Produce direct HTTP calls to deliver the {product_name} system events to the supporting services.
** Consume the workflow incoming events in the workflow service root path `/` via HTTP POST calls.
** No eventing system is configured to produce the workflow business events, and thus, an attempt to produce such event will fail.

== Eventing System linking objects

The linking of the workflow with the eventing system is produced by using Knative Eventing SinkBindings and Triggers.
These objects are automatically created by the {operator_name}, and facilitate workflow events production and consumption.

The following example shows the Knative Eventing objects created for an `example-workflow` configured with a platform-scoped eventing system.
