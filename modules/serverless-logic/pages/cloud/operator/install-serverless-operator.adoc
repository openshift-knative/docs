This guide describes how to install the {operator_name} in a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster. The operator is in an xref:cloud/operator/known-issues.adoc[early development stage] (community only) and has been tested on OpenShift {openshift_version_min}+, Kubernetes {kubernetes_version}+, and link:{minikube_url}[Minikube].

.Prerequisites
* A Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster with admin privileges and `kubectl` installed. 
* Alternatively, you can use Minikube or KIND in your local environment. See xref:getting-started/preparing-environment.adoc#proc-minimal-local-environment-setup[minimal environment setup] and xref:getting-started/preparing-environment.adoc#proc-starting-cluster-fo-local-development[starting the cluster for local development] guides.

== {product_name} Operator OpenShift installation

=== Install

To install the operator on OpenShift refer to the "link:{openshift_operator_install_url}[Adding Operators to a cluster]" from the OpenShift's documentation.

When searching for the operator in the *Filter by keyword* field, use the word `{operator_openshift_keyword}`. If you're installing from the CLI, the operator's catalog name is `{operator_openshift_catalog}`.

=== Uninstall

To remove the operator on OpenShift refer to the "link:{openshift_operator_uninstall_url}[Deleting Operators from a cluster]" from the OpenShift's documentation.

== {product_name} Operator Kubernetes installation

=== Install

To install the operator on Kubernetes refer to the  "link:{kubernetes_operator_install_url}[How to install an Operator from OperatorHub.io]" from the OperatorHub's documentation.

When link:{operatorhub_url}[searching for the operator in the *Search OperatorHub* field], use the word `{operator_k8s_keyword}`.

=== Uninstall

To remove the operator on Kubernetes follow the document "link:{kubernetes_operator_uninstall_url}[Uninstall your operator]" from the OLM's documentation.

When searching for the subscription to remove, use the word `{operator_k8s_subscription}`.

== {product_name} Operator Manual Installation

[WARNING]
====
If you're running on Kubernetes or OpenShift, it is highly recommended to install the operator from the OperatorHub or OpenShift Console instead since the installation is managed by OLM. Use this method only if you need a snapshot version or you're running locally on Minikube or KIND.
====

.Prerequisites
* You have set up your environment according to the xref:getting-started/preparing-environment.adoc#proc-minimal-local-environment-setup[minimal environment setup] guide.
* You have the cluster instance up and running. See xref:getting-started/preparing-environment.adoc#proc-starting-cluster-fo-local-development[starting the cluster for local development] guide.

=== Install

To install the {product_name} Operator, you can use the following command:

.Install {product_name} Operator on Kubernetes
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl create -f {kogito_operator_repository_rawcontent_url}/{operator_version}/operator.yaml
----
Replace `<version>` with specific version if needed:
----
kubectl create -f {kogito_operator_repository_rawcontent_url}/<version>/operator.yaml
----
`<version>` could be `{product_version_long}` for instance.

You can follow the deployment of the {product_name} Operator:

.Watch the {product_name} Operator pod
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl get pod -n {operator_installation_namespace} --watch
----

A successful installation should have an output like this:

.Successful Installation Output
[source]
----
NAME                                                     READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
{operator_controller_manager_deployment_name}-948547ffd-sr2j2   0/2     ContainerCreating   0          6s
{operator_controller_manager_deployment_name}-948547ffd-sr2j2   1/2     Running             0          7s
{operator_controller_manager_deployment_name}-948547ffd-sr2j2   2/2     Running             0          20s
----

You can also follow the operator’s log:

.Watch the {product_name} Operator pod logs
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl logs deployment/{operator_controller_manager_deployment_name} -n {operator_installation_namespace} -f
----

Once the operator is running, it will watch for instances of the {product_name} Custom Resources (CR). Using CRs, you can configure your {product_name} environment and define Workflows and builds to be handled by the operator.

=== Uninstall

To uninstall the {operator_name}, first, you must delete all the {product_name} Custom Resources (CR) instances managed by it. Once the CRs are deleted, you can then delete all resources created during the operator installation.

To delete every CR managed by the operator in your cluster, you can run these series of commands:

.Delete all {product_name} CR instances
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl delete --all workflow --all-namespaces
kubectl delete --all sonataflowbuild --all-namespaces
kubectl delete --all sonataflowplatform --all-namespaces
----

Alternatively, if you created everything under the same Namespace, deleting the given namespace has the same outcome.

To uninstall the correct version of the operator, first you must get the current version by running:

.Getting the operator version
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl get deployment {operator_controller_manager_deployment_name} -n {operator_installation_namespace} -o jsonpath="{.spec.template.spec.containers[?(@.name=='manager')].image}"

{sonataflow_operator_imagename}:{operator_version}
----

.Uninstalling the operator
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl delete -f {kogito_operator_repository_rawcontent_url}/<version>/operator.yaml
----

[TIP]
====
The URL should be the same as the one you used when installing the operator.
