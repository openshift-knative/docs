This document describes how to configure and deploy the {product_name}'s xref:data-index/data-index-core-concepts.adoc[Data Index] and xref:job-services/core-concepts.adoc[Job Service] supporting services, using the {operator_name}.

In general, in a regular {product_name} installation you must deploy both services to ensure a successful execution of your workflows. To get more information about each service please read the respective guides.

.Prerequisites
* The {operator_name} installed. See xref:cloud/operator/install-serverless-operator.adoc[] guide.
* A PostgreSQL database service instance. Required if you are planning to use the <<postgresql-persistence-configuration>> for a supporting service.

[#supporting-services-workflow-communications]
== Supporting Services and Workflow communications

When you deploy a supporting service in a given namespace, you can do it by using an <<enabled-deployment-field, enabled or disabled>> deployment.

An enabled deployment, signals the {operator_name} to automatically intercept every workflow deployment with the `preview` or `gitops` profile, in this namespace, and automatically configure it to connect with that service.

For example, if the Data Index is enabled, a workflow will be automatically configured to send workflow status change events to it.
And, similar configurations are produced if the Job Service is enabled, to create a Job, every time a workflow requires a timeout.
Additionally, the operator will configure the Job Service to send events to the Data Index Service, etc.

As you can see, the operator can not only deploy a supporting service, but also, manage other configurations to ensure the successful execution of a workflow.

Fortunately, all these configurations are managed automatically, and you must only provide the supporting services configuration in the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR.

[NOTE]
====
Scenarios where you only deploy one of the supporting services, or configure a disabled deployment, are intended for advanced use cases.
In a regular installation, you must normally configure an enabled deployment of both services to ensure a successful execution of your workflows.
====

[#deploy-supporting-services]
== Deploying the supporting services using the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR

To deploy the supporting services you must use the sub-fields `dataIndex` and `jobService` in the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR `spec.services`.
That information signals the {operator_name} to deploy each service when the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR is deployed.

[NOTE]
====
Each service configuration is considered independently, and you can combine these configurations with any other configuration present in the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR.
====

The following `SonataFlowPlatform` CR fragment shows a scaffold configuration that you can use as reference:
[#supporting-services-configuration]
.Supporting services configuration
[source,yam]
----
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlowPlatform
metadata:
  name: sonataflow-platform-example
  namespace: example-namespace
spec:
  services:
    dataIndex: <1>
      enabled: true <2>
      # Specific configurations for the Data Index Service
      # might be included here
    jobService: <3>
      enabled: true <4>
      # Specific configurations for the Job Service
      # might be included here
----
[#enabled-deployment-field]
<1> Data Index Service configuration field.
<2> If true, produces an enabled Data Index Service deployment, <<supporting-services-workflow-communications, see>>. Other cases produce a disabled deployment. The default is `false`.
<3> Job Service configuration field.
<4>  If true, produces an enabled Job Service deployment, <<supporting-services-workflow-communications, see>>. Other cases produce a disabled deployment. The default is `false`.

[NOTE]
====
The configuration above produces an ephemeral deployment of each service, <<ephemeral-persistence-configuration, see>>.
====

== Supporting Services Scope

The `SonataFlowPlatform` CR facilitates the deployment of the supporting services with namespace scope.
It means that, all the automatically configured <<supporting-services-workflow-communications>>, are restricted to the namespace of the given platform.
This can be useful, in cases where you need separate supporting service instances for a set of workflows.
For example, a given application can be deployed isolated with its workflows, and the supporting services.

Additionally, using the `SonataFlowClusterPlatform` CR it's possible to configure a <<cluster-scoped-deployment, cluster scoped deployment>> of the supporting services.

== Configuring the Supporting Services Persistence

[#ephemeral-persistence-configuration]
=== Ephemeral persistence configuration

The ephemeral persistence of a service is supported by an embedded PostgreSQL database dedicated to it. That database is re-created by the operator on every service restart.
And thus, it's only recommended for development and testing purposes.

The ephemeral deployment of a service requires no additional configurations than the shown, <<supporting-services-configuration, here>>.

[#postgresql-persistence-configuration]
=== PostgreSQL persistence configuration

The PostgreSQL persistence of a service is supported by a PostgreSQL server instance that you must previously install on the cluster.
The administration of that instance is totally independent of the {operator_name} scope, and to connect a supporting service with it, you must only configure the correct database connection parameters.

The following `SonataFlowPlatform` CR fragment shows the configuration options that you must use:

----

<1> Name of the Kubernetes Service to connect with the PostgreSQL database server.
<2> (Optional) Kubernetes namespace containing the PostgreSQL Service. Defaults to the `SonataFlowPlatform's` local namespace.
<3> Name of the PostgreSQL database to store the supporting service data.
<4> (Optional) Name of the PostgreSQL database schema to store the supporting service data.
Defaults to the `SonataFlowPlatform's` `name`, suffixed with `-data-index-service` or `-jobs-service`. For example, `sonataflow-platform-example-data-index-service`.
<5> (Optional) Port number to connect with the PostgreSQL Service. Defaults to 5432.
<6> Name of the link:{k8n_secrets_url}[Kubernetes Secret] containing the username and password to connect with the database.
<7> Name of the link:{k8n_secrets_url}[Kubernetes Secret] `key` containing the username to connect with the database.
<8> Name of the link:{k8n_secrets_url}[Kubernetes Secret] `key` containing the password to connect with the database.

[NOTE]
====
The persistence of each service can be configured independently by using the respective `persistence` field.
====

To create the secrets for the example above you can use a command like this:

.Create secret example
[source,bash]
----
kubectl create secret generic postgres-secrets-example  --from-literal=POSTGRESQL_USER=<user> --from-literal=POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=<password> -n postgres-example-namespace
----


[#common-persistence-configuration]
=== Common PostgreSQL persistence configuration

To configure a common PostgreSQL service instance for all the supporting services you must read, xref:cloud/operator/using-persistence.adoc#configuring-persistence-using-the-sonataflowplatform-cr[Configuring the persistence using the SonataFlowPlatform CR].

In that case, the {operator_name} will automatically connect any of the supporting services with that common server configured in the field `spec.persistence`. And, similarly to the workflow's persistence, the following precedence rules apply:

* If a supporting service has a configured persistence, for example, the field `services.dataIndex.persistence` is configured. That configuration will apply.

* If a supporting service has no configured persistence, for example, the field `services.dataIndex.persistence` is not set at all, the persistence configuration will be taken from the current platform.


[NOTE]
====
When you use the common PostgreSQL configuration, the database schema for each supporting service is automatically configured as the SonataFlowPlatform’s `name`, suffixed with `-data-index-service` or `-jobs-service` respectively.
For example, `sonataflow-platform-example-data-index-service`.
====

[#configuring-supporting-services-eventing-system]
== Configuring the supporting services Eventing system

In general, the following events are produced in a {product_name} installation:

* Workflow outgoing and incoming business events.
* {product_name} system events sent from the workflow to the Data Index and Job Service respectively.
* {product_name} system events sent from the Jobs Service to the Data Index Service.

The {operator_name} is designed to use the link:{knative_eventing_url}[Knative Eventing] system to resolve all the event communication between these services.

[NOTE]
====
In a regular {product_name} installation, the preferred method is to use the <<platform-scoped-eventing-system-configuration, Platform scoped Eventing System Configuration>>, while the <<service-scoped-eventing-system-configuration, Service scoped Eventing System configuration>> is reserved only for advanced use cases.
====

[#platform-scoped-eventing-system-configuration]
=== Platform-scoped Eventing system configuration

To configure a platform-scoped eventing system, you must use the field `spec.eventing.broker.ref` in the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR to refer to a Knative Eventing Broker.

This information signals the {operator_name} to automatically link the supporting services to `produce` and `consume` the events by using that Broker.

Additionally, workflows deployed in that namespace, with the `preview` or `gitops` profile, that don't provide a custom eventing system configuration, will be linked to that Broker.
For more information about configuring the workflow eventing system, xref:cloud/operator/configuring-workflow-eventing-system.adoc[see].

The following `SonataFlowPlatform` CR fragment shows an example of such configuration:

.Platform scoped eventing system configuration example
include::../common/platform-scoped-eventing-system-configuration-example.adoc[]


[#service-scoped-eventing-system-configuration]
=== Service-scoped Eventing system configuration

A service scoped eventing system configuration provides the ability to do a fine-grained configuration of the Eventing system for the <<data-index-eventing-system-configuration, Data Index>> or the <<jos-service-eventing-system-configuration, Jobs Service>>.

[NOTE]
====
In a regular {product_name} installation, the preferred method is to use a <<platform-scoped-eventing-system-configuration, Platform-scoped Eventing System Configuration>>, while the service-scoped configuration is reserved only for advanced use cases.
====

[#data-index-eventing-system-configuration]
=== Data Index Eventing system configuration

To configure a service-scoped eventing system for the Data Index, you must use the field `spec.services.dataIndex.source.ref` in the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR to refer to a specific Knative Eventing Broker.

This information signals the {operator_name} to automatically link the Data Index to `consume` the {product_name} system events from that Broker.

In production environments, you must use a production-ready broker, like the link:{knative_eventing_kafka_broker_url}[Knative Kafka Broker].
====

[#jos-service-eventing-system-configuration]
=== Jobs Service Eventing system configuration

To configure a service-scoped eventing system for the Jobs Service, you must use the fields `spec.services.jobService.source.ref` and `spec.services.jobService.sink.ref` in the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR.

This information signals the {operator_name} to automatically link the Jobs Service to `consume` and `produce` the {product_name} system events from that configuration respectively.

[NOTE]
====
In production environments, you must use production-ready brokers, like the link:{knative_eventing_kafka_broker_url}[Knative Kafka Broker].
====

[#cluster-scoped-eventing-system-configuration]
=== Cluster-scoped Eventing system configuration

When you use a <<cluster-scoped-deployment>> deployment, the supporting services are automatically linked to the `Broker` configured in the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR referred to by the `SonataFlowClusterPlatform` CR.

=== Eventing system configuration precedence rules

To configure the eventing system for a supporting service, the {operator_name} use the following precedence rules:

. If the supporting service has a configured eventing system, by using any of the <<data-index-eventing-system-configuration>> or <<jos-service-eventing-system-configuration>> respectively, that configuration applies.

. If the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR enclosing the supporting service, is configured with a <<platform-scoped-eventing-system-configuration>>, that configuration applies.

. If the current cluster, is configured with a <<cluster-scoped-eventing-system-configuration>>, that configuration apply.

. If none of the previous configurations exists, the supporting service is configured to produce direct HTTP calls to deliver events.

=== Eventing System linking objects

The linking of the supporting services with the Eventing System is produced by using Knative Eventing SinkBindings and Triggers.
These objects are automatically created by the {operator_name}, and facilitate the events production and consumption from the supporting services.

The following example shows the Knative Native eventing objects created for the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR:

----

<1> Number of replicas. Defaults to 1. In the case of the jobService this value is always overridden to 1 by the operator, since that service is a singleton service.
<2> Holds the particular configurations for the container that will execute the given supporting service.
<3> Standard Kubernetes `env` configuration. This can be useful in cases where you need to fine tune any of the supporting services properties.
<4> Standard Kubernetes `image` configuration. This can be useful in cases where you need to use an updated image for any of the supporting services.
<5> Standard Kubernetes `initContainers` for the Pod that executes the supporting service.

[NOTE]
====
The `podTemplate` field of any supporting service has the majority of fields defined in the default Kubernetes PodSpec API.
The same Kubernetes API validation rules apply to these fields.

[#cluster-scoped-deployment]
== Cluster Scoped Supporting Services

The `SonataFlowClusterPlatform` CR is optionally used to specify a cluster-wide set of supporting services for workflow consumption.
This is done by referencing an existing, namespaced `SonataFlowPlatform` CR.

Following is a basic configuration that allows workflows, deployed in any namespace, to leverage supporting services deployed in the chosen `example-namespace` namespace.

== Conclusions

The {operator_name} extends its scope to manage the lifecycle of the xref:data-index/data-index-core-concepts.adoc[Data Index] and xref:job-services/core-concepts.adoc[Job Service] instances, thus removing the burden on the users and allowing them to focus on the implementation of the workflows.
It takes care also of managing all the configurations to facilitate communication between the workflows and the supporting services.
Additionally, it can manage different persistence options for each service, and advanced configurations.
