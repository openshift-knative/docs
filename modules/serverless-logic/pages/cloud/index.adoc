{product_name} is evolving as platform to build and deploy workflow applications in Kubernetes clusters.

You have two options to deploy your workflow applications: either as a full Quarkus project or using the {operator_name}.

The cards below list all features included in the platform to deploy workflow applications either with Quarkus or the Operator.

[NOTE]
====
Eventually, these two options will converge, and the {operator_name} will also be able to handle full Quarkus projects. So if you opt-in to use Quarkus now and manually deploy your workflows, bear in mind that it's on the project's roadmap to integrate the Quarkus experience with the Operator.

== Kubernetes with the Operator

For developers that are looking for a native Kubernetes approach where you can model workflows using YAML definitions and directly deploy them, you can use the {operator_name}. The operator registers a new Kubernetes resource in the cluster to manage your workflow development iteration cycle and composition of services and events. The application is managed by the operator.

== Kubernetes with Quarkus

For Java developers, you can use Quarkus and a few add-ons to help you build and deploy the application in a Kubernetes cluster. {product_name} also generates basic Kubernetes objects YAML files to help you getting started. The application should be managed by a Kubernetes administrator.
