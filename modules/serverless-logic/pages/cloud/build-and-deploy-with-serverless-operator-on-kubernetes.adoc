This document describes how to build and deploy your workflow application using a Kubernetes cluster with the link:{kogito_serverless_operator_url}[{product_name} Serverless Operator]. If you don't have any cluster operational, link:{minikube_url}[Minikube] commands are given throughout the guide.

Using the {product_name} Operator, you will be able to build and deploy a {product_name} application only by having a workflow definition.

If you already have a container built and pushed to a container registry and you want to deploy it on the Kubernetes cluster, then you can do it without the operator following the guide xref:cloud/deploying-on-kubernetes.adoc[Deploying your {context} application on Kubernetes].

The link:{kogito_serverless_operator_url}[{product_name} Operator] is currently in Alpha version, is under active development and is at the moment supporting {context} definitions that are using:

* Functions
* States
    - Switch including dataConditions
    - Inject including data with a transition
* Operations including Actions containing functionRef with arguments
* KeepActive
* AutoRetries
* ExpressionsLang (jq or jsonpath)

.Prerequisites
* A workflow definition.
* A Kubernetes cluster with admin privileges. If you haven't got one prepare, you can use a local link:{minikube_url}[Minikube] instance.
* `kubectl` command-line tool is installed. Otherwise, Minikube provides it.

== Prepare a Minikube instance

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
minikube start --cpus 4 --memory 4096 --addons registry --addons metrics-server --insecure-registry "10.0.0.0/24" --insecure-registry "localhost:5000"
----

[NOTE]
====
To speed up the build time, you can increase CPUs and memory options so that you minikube instance will have more resources. For example, use `--cpus 12 --memory 16384`.
====

[TIP]
====
If it does not work with the default driver, as known as `docker`, you can try to start with the `podman` driver as follows:
====

.Start minikube with podman driver
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
minikube start [...] --driver podman
----


[IMPORTANT]
====
There are some issues with the `crio` container runtime and Kaniko that the operator is using. Reference: link:{kaniko_issue_url}[ISSUE-2201]
====

== Setup {product_name} Operator

In order to have an up-and-running instance of the {product_name} Operator you can use the following command:

.Install {product_name} Operator on Kubernetes
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiegroup/kogito-serverless-operator/{operator_version}/operator.yaml
----

You can follow, then, the deployment of the {product_name} Operator:

.Watch the {product_name} Operator pod
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl get pod -n kogito-serverless-operator-system --watch
----

You can also follow the operator’s log:

.Watch the {product_name} Operator pod logs
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl logs deployment/kogito-serverless-operator-controller-manager -n kogito-serverless-operator-system -f
----

Once the operator is running, it will watch for new custom resources (CR) so that you can prepare your environment to be ready to build a new {context} application based on the definitions you will send to the operator.

== Preparing for the build

You should follow these steps to create a container that you can deploy as a service on Kubernetes.

=== Create a namespace for the building phase

Let's create a new namespace that will hold all the resources that we (or the operator) will create (pods, deployments, services, secretes, config map, and Custom Resources) in this guide.

.Create a namespace for the application to build & run in
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl create namespace kogito-workflows
----

=== Create a secret for the container registry authentication
.Create a secret for the container registry authentication
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred --docker-server=<registry_url> --docker-username=<registry_username> --docker-password=<registry_password> --docker-email=<registry_email> -n kogito-workflows
----

or you can directly import your local docker config into your Kubernetes cluster:

.Create a secret for the container registry authentication based on local docker config
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl create secret generic regcred --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=${HOME}/.docker/config.json --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson -n kogito-workflows
----

=== Create a {product_name} Platform containing the configuration (i.e. registry address, secret) for building your workflows

The {product_name} Platform CR is the resource used to control the behavior of the {product_name} Operator.
It defines the behavior of all Custom Resources (Workflow and Build) in the given namespace.

Since the {product_name} Operator is installed in global mode, you will need to specify a {product_name} Platform CR in each namespace where you want the operator to be executed.
You can find a basic {product_name} Serverless Platform CR example in the `config/samples` folder that you can simply apply to configure your operator.

.Create a {product_name} Platform CR
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiegroup/kogito-serverless-operator/{operator_version}/config/samples/sw.kogito_v1alpha08_kogitoserverlessplatform.yaml -n kogito-workflows
----

Note: In this Custom Resource, spec.platform.registry.secret is the name of the secret you created just before.

[TIP]
====
You can also update "on-the-fly" the {product_name} Platform CR registry field with this command (change <YOUR_REGISTRY>)

.Create a {product_name} Platform CR with a specific registry
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiegroup/kogito-serverless-operator/{operator_version}/config/samples/sw.kogito_v1alpha08_kogitoserverlessplatform.yaml | sed "s|address: .*|address: <YOUR_REGISTRY>" | kubectl apply -f -
----

In order to retrieve the Cluster IP address of Minikube's internal registry to configure your platform, you can use the following command:

.Retrieve Minikube registry internal IP
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl get svc registry -n kube-system -ojsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}'
----
====

== Build and deploy your {context} application

You can now send your {product_name} Custom Resource to the operator which includes the {context} definition.

You can find a basic {product_name} Platform CR example in the `config/samples` folder that you can simply apply to configure your operator.

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiegroup/kogito-serverless-operator/{operator_version}/config/samples/sw.kogito_v1alpha08_kogitoserverlessworkflow.yaml -n kogito-workflows
----
You can check the logs of the build of your workflow via:

.Get the {product_name} application pod logs
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl logs kogito-greeting-builder -n kogito-workflows
----

The final pushed image must be printed into the logs at the end of the build.

== Check the {product_name} application is running
In order to check that the {product_name} Greeting application is up and running, you can try to perform a test HTTP call, from the greeting pod.

.Check the greeting application is running
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
kubectl patch svc greeting -n kogito-workflows -p '{"spec": {"type": "NodePort"}}'
GREETING_SVC=$(minikube service greeting -n kogito-workflows --url)
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -H 'Accept:application/json' -d '{"name": "John", "language": "English"}' $GREETING_SVC/greeting
----

If everything is working well you should receive a response like this:

.Response from the greeting application
[source,json,subs="attributes+"]
----
{"id":"b5fbfaa3-b125-4e6c-9311-fe5a3577efdd","workflowdata":{"name":"John","language":"English","greeting":"Hello from JSON Workflow, "}}
----
