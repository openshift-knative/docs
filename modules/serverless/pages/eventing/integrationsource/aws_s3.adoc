This page describes how to use the AWS S3 service with the `IntegrationSource` API for Eventing in {serverlessproductname}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{serverlessproductname} `IntegrationSource` is a Developer Preview feature only.

Developer Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete.
Red Hat does not recommend using them in production.
These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Developer Preview features, see https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/devpreview/.

== Amazon credentials

For connecting to AWS the `IntegrationSource` uses Kubernetes `Secret`, present in the namespace of the resource. The `Secret` can be created like:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n <namespace> create secret generic my-secret --from-literal=aws.accessKey=<accessKey> --from-literal=aws.secretKey=<secretKey>
----

== AWS S3 Source Example

Below is an `IntegrationSource` to receive data from an Amazon S3 Bucket.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: IntegrationSource
metadata:
  name: integration-source-aws-s3
  namespace: knative-samples
spec:
  aws:
    s3:
      arn: "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket"
      region: "eu-north-1"
    auth:
      secret:
        ref:
        name: "my-secret"
  sink:
    ref:
      apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Broker
      name: default
----

Inside of the `aws.s3` object we define the name of the bucket (or _arn_) and its region. The credentials for the AWS service are referenced from the `my-secret` Kubernetes `Secret`
